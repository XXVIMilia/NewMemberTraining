New Member Training Notes:
Ultrasonic: D12, D13 (HCSR04: https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/hc-sr04/)
Servo: D10 or D11 (ServoLibrary: https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/servo/)
Infrared: A0, A1, A2 (AnalogRead: https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/analog-io/analogread/)
Remote Control: (Complicated, I think???)
IMU: (We'll use this later, its complicated-ish)
Camera: (Also complicated)
WiFi: (Even more complicated)
RGB: D4 (FastLED: https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/fastled/)
MotorA: D5, D8 (Speed*,Direction**)
MotorB: D6, D7



*Speed SEEMS to use AnalogWrite (0-255), This is the same as using PWM DutyCycle Control. 
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ANALOG PINS, just stupid naming conventions
**Direction SEEMS to use DigitalWrite(0,1)
